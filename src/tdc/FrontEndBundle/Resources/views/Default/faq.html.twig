        <h2><a name="payments"/>About Payments</a></h2>
        <li class="question">What are my payment options?</li>
        <p>All TD Channel payments are handled through a <a href="http://paypal.com" target="_blank">Paypal</a> subscription service. We ofer monthly, 3 months, 6 months and yearly subscriptions.
        <li class="question">Can I cancel any time?</li>
        <p>Absolutely! There are no contracts here at TD Channel. Do keep in mind that when you cancel your current active subscription, the subscription will remain active until its expiration date. So if you cancel a 3 month subscription one month into it, the subscription will continue to be active for another 2 months.</p>
        <li class="question">What is the refund policy?</li>
        <p>If for some reason you are not satisfied with out service, you can request a refund. Refunds will be calculated the following way:</p>
        <p>(cost of subscription / subscription length) * remainder of subscription.</p>
        <p>For example: User signs up for a 12 month subscription, but 3 months into the year decides to cancel it. If the subscription cost a total of 100 USD, the refund would be</br></br><center>100 (cost) / 12 (months) = 8.33 (cost per month) * 9 (remaining months) = 74.97 refund</center> </p>
